# Sequence-Detector
A Mealy synchronous sequential circuit has one input and one output. The circuit examines a string of 0’s and 1’s applied to its input and generates an output when the sequence 1101 is detected at the input. Design the circuit described above using JK flip-flops. The circuit should be non-overlapping.
